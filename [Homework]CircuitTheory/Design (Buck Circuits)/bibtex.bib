	abstract = {In this paper, a Zero-Voltage-Transition (ZVT) Pulsewidth Modulated (PWM) synchronous buck converter (SBC), with a simple passive auxiliary circuit is proposed, which reduces the stresses and improves the efficiency by pacifying the conduction losses compared to a traditional PWM converter, typically suitable for photovoltaic applications. The important design feature of ZVT-PWM SBC converters is placement of resonant components that mollifies the conduction losses. Due to the ZVT, the resonant components with low values are used thereby resulting in the increase of switching frequency. The zero-voltage-transition operation of the proposed converter is presented through theoretical analysis. The characteristics of the proposed converter are verified with the simulation in the PSIM cosimulated with MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the theoretical and practical considerations to construct a DC-DC buck converter for low-power applications. The control law is based on the sliding-mode control theory that fits the physical behavior of the DC-DC converter. The experimental results show that is possible to construct a simple control by monitoring one of the circuit state variables (voltage on the capacitor). The sliding-mode control helps to drive the output DC value in spite of the circuit variations and load conditions. The experimental results show a reliable regulated voltage of 3.3 V and 4.3 V with a 125kHz reference frequency.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a simple auxiliary circuit is utilized to provide soft-switching condition for the conventional buck converter. The utilized auxiliary circuit contains no switches and without significant additional losses eliminates switching losses completely. This structure contains just one switch which is the conventional buck converter's main switch, and turns on under ZVS condition, and turns off under near to soft-switching condition. Furthermore, the only utilized power diode turns off under ZCS condition. Consequently, switching and reverse recovery losses have been approximately eliminated and the proposed structure operates with high power efficiency. Due to the mentioned features, this converter can be an optimal structure for high-efficiency required applications. In this paper, the operational modes, designing components, power efficiency, and comparison results are discussed in detail. In addition, in order to verify the claimed features, a laboratory prototype of the proposed converter at 175 W output power and 185 kHz frequency is assembled in the laboratory and the results have been investigated completely. In addition, in order to investigate the soft-switching operation of the analyzed structure at light loads, the soft-switching waveforms are achieved for 100 W and 50 W output powers under the same switching frequency.},

In addition, a 1 kW prototype is designed and established. Results of simulations and experiments verify the validity of the theoretical analysis.
